          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Negative aspects of the UI/UX: &nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>The content order needs improvement, with the donation button being more prominently displayed&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The "About Us" button in the navigation bar is too generic and should be renamed&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The website lacks interactive elements and could benefit from more hovers and carousels to increase user engagement Some tasks require too many inputs from the user, which slows down the process and creates confusion&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The website could benefit from a better navigation flow to improve efficiency &nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Improvements Implemented:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Based on the testing results, we would make several improvements&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rearranging the order of content to display the service and donation button more prominently&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Renaming the "About Us" button to "Our Team" in the navigation bar&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Adding more interactive elements to increase user engagement, such as hovers and carousels&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Simplifying the user input process to enhance efficiency and reduce confusion Improving the navigation flow to make the website more user-friendly.. &nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <br>
          <p>Xpat is a brand that wants to make the lives of expats easier and more fulfilling by providing a platform where they can connect with other expats who are going through the similar experiences. Our mission is to create a sense of community among expats, allowing them to build friendships, share knowledge, and support one another throughout their journey abroad.

To achieve our goals, we have taken a strategic approach to our promotional activities, with a strong focus on engagement and community building. We created an Instagram page that is filled with content for our audience (expats), including fun facts, quotes from users, tips of the week, event posters, did you know, and reels. By offering a variety of content, we aim to attract expats from all ages. We posted almost every day 2 times a day and 1 story a day.

Our promotional activities were designed to increase our follower count and encourage people to join Xpat, our website. By using Instagram as a promotional tool, we were able to reach a wide audience of expats who are active on the platform. Through our content, we showcased the benefits of joining Xpat and the value that our platform can provide for expats.

Our Communication & Media Plan is focused on building a strong community for expats who are engaged and active on our platform. By providing valuable content and encouraging participation, we were able to build a loyal following of expats who were invested in our brand and committed to helping others within the community.

Overall, our promotional activities were an essential part, and we were committed to continuing to engage with our audience and build a strong community of expats who feel supported and connected through our platform xpat.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
		   <br>
          <p>Through the project while we executed the Communication & Media Plan, we  gained valuable insights and learning points that we can use for future marketing stuff. 

We expected that using Instagram as a promotional tool would be effective in reaching our target audience of expats, and this expectation was confirmed through the engagement we received on our posts.

However, we did not expect to gain as many followers as we had hoped for within the timeframe of our objectives. Despite this, we learned that consistent posting of a variety of content types, including interactive content and Reels, can lead to increased engagement and a wider reach. We also learned that it is important to listen to our audience and tailor our content to their interests and needs.

One of our main takeaways from our experience executing the Communication & Media Plan was the importance of community building. By creating a space where expats can connect with one another and share their experiences, we were able to build a loyal following of engaged users who felt supported and valued. We also learned the importance of measuring and analyzing our metrics to understand what is working and what can be improved upon in our marketing efforts.

Overall, our experience with executing the Communication & Media Plan for Xpat has taught us valuable lessons about effective marketing strategies for reaching and engaging with our target audience. We are excited to continue building our community of expats and applying what we have learned to future marketing efforts.
</p>
          
<p>Another learning point was the importance of consistent branding and messaging. The Xpat Online Instagram account has maintained a consistent visual identity through the use of a specific color scheme and branded graphics. The captions also consistently convey the message of the brand's mission to help expats in their new countries. This consistency has helped to establish a strong brand identity and create a sense of trust and familiarity with the audience.;</p> If we were to do this project again, We would use additional platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, to reach a wider audience. Additionally, We would recommend exploring different types of promotional activities that can help to increase long-term engagement and conversions. Finally, We would suggest measuring the effectiveness of the promotional activities and adjusting the strategy accordingly to achieve the desired results. </p>

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
				 <br>
          <p>Based on our past experience executing the Communication & Media Plan for Xpat, we would like to make some changes to our future planning in order to achieve our objectives more effectively. Firstly, we would like to reassess our target audience and create a more detailed persona that takes into account the specific needs and interests of expats.

With this new persona in mind, we would create new objectives for the upcoming period that are more specific and measurable. For example, we might aim to increase our follower count by a certain percentage within a set timeframe, or to increase the number of user-generated content submissions by a certain amount.

We would also create a content calendar that is tailored to the interests and needs of our target audience, with a focus on interactive content that encourages engagement and conversation. In addition, we would increase our use of Reels and other video content, as we have found that this is an effective way to reach a wider audience.

To track our progress and measure the success of our marketing efforts, we would continue to monitor our metrics and analyze the data to understand what is working and what can be improved upon. We would also consider running targeted ads on Instagram to reach a larger audience and drive more traffic to the Xpat website.

Overall, by taking into account what we have learned from our past experience executing the Communication & Media Plan for Xpat, we believe that we can create a more effective and engaging marketing strategy for the future.

              2.	No reach of information of your new country
              3.	Almost impossible to make new contacts </li>
            <li>&nbsp;</li>
<p class="fw-bold">Existing alternatives:</p>
          <ul>
			   <li>Loneliness:
Dating apps, Tinder

No reach of information:

Almost impossible to make new contacts:
Going to public places and talk to people.
</li>
          </ul>
			         </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A website designed for expats where they can create an account and where they fill in their interest, their hobbies, and a little story about themselves. 
<br>
We provide events where expats can sign up to and get to know each other during an activity. As a member you can see who has signed up and see their profiles with their information. In this way it makes it more personal.
<br>
Every event has one expact coordinater, this is a expat who coordinates that event and from who you can see the phone number and reach out to. In this way it is less scary to participate in a event.
<br>
To become a member you have to verifiy yourself. In this way we make sure that it is safe. The meeting points for the events are at public places so it is safer. Member can not see each other personal information unless a member choose to have that public.
