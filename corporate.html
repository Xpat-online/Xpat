<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <br>
          <p><strong>Objectives:&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>With our marketing campaign were aiming to increase our brand's social media presence on Instagram. We want to gain a target number of followers and engagement. By the date of April 10th, we want to aim to have at least 60 followers on Instagram, who are genuinely interested in our brand and the service we offer. We also want to aim to achieve a minimum of 55 engagements on all of our Instagram posts, including for example: likes &amp; comments, but also shares. Because this will help us to increase our brand's visibility and attract more followers who maybe will be joining xpat&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Chosen platform:</strong></p>
          <p> We chose Instagram as our only platform because it is very popular among our target audience expats and Instagram is a visually appealing and interactive platform for sharing content. With its emphasis on visual content, we can try to showcase the benefits of joining our platform by posting engaging and visually appealing posts that resonate with our target audience. Also, Instagram's makes use of hashtags, and they have a explore page which enables us to reach a wider audience and increase our follower count through the explore page. We believe that Instagram is an effective platform for us to reach and engage with our target audience of expats.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Target audience:&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>We have identified the target audience for Xpat as expats who are currently living in a foreign country or planning to relocate abroad. Because these people may have moved for various reasons such as work, interests, or study, and because of this we think they maybe are seeking to connect with other expats in their new location to establish a sense of community and belonging. Also, they are likely to have an interest in learning about the local culture, customs, and events in their new home country. Although the age, gender, and nationality of this audience may vary, they all share the common experience of living abroad and the desire to connect with like-minded individuals through our service.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Context of campaign and promotional activities</strong></p>
          <p>As Xpat, our brand is mostly focused on making the lives of expats easier and more fulfilling by providing a platform where they can connect with others going through the similar experiences. To achieve this, we took a strategic approach to our promotional activities with a focus on engagement and community building. We created an Instagram page filled with content for our audience, including fun facts, user quotes, tips of the week, event posters, and reels. By offering a variety of content, we aimed to attract expats of all ages. We posted almost every day, twice a day, and added one story per day to encourage people to join Xpat and follow and engage with us. By using Instagram as a promotional tool, we were able to reach a wide audience of expats. With our content we showcased the benefits of joining Xpat and the value our platform provides for expats. Our Communication &amp; Media Plan was focused on building a strong and engaged expat community by valuable content and encouraging participation. We were able to build a loyal following of people invested in our brand. Overall, our promotional activities were important, and we want to remain committed to engaging with our audience and building a strong community of expats who feel supported and connected through our platform. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
		   <br>
          <p>During our project, we executed the Communication &amp; Media Plan, and we gained valuable insights and learning points that we can use for future marketing projects. We expected that using Instagram as a promotional tool would be effective in reaching our target audience of expats, and we confirmed this through the engagement we received on our posts. However, we didn't expect to gain more followers who aren’t expats but still interested in our service and content on instagram. We reached the followers that we hoped for within the timeframe of our objectives. Despite this, we learned that posting consistently with a variety of content types, including interactive content and Reels, can lead to more engagement and a wider reach. We also learned that it's important to listen to our audience and tailor our content to their interests and needs, because then they would engage more with our content.
          </p>
          
          <p>We also learned about the importance of consistent branding and messaging. Our Instagram page maintained a consistent visual identity using a specific color scheme and branded graphics with our logos. With our captions we also showed the message of our brand's mission to help expats in their new countries. This consistency helped us to establish a strong brand identity and created a sense of trust and familiarity with the audience. Which is an important thing we really wanted.</p>
          <p>If we were to do this project again, we would use more and different platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn, to reach a wider audience, especially to reach our expat target audience. Also, we would in the future want different types of promotional activities that can help increase long-term engagement and conversions for xpat. Finally, we want to measure the effectiveness of the promotional activities and adjust the strategy accordingly to achieve the desired results more. Overall, our experience executing the Communication &amp; Media Plan for Xpat has taught us valuable lessons about effective marketing strategies for reaching and engaging with our target audience, and we're excited to apply this in future projects.</p>

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
				 <br>
          <p>In our future planning for Xpat, we will use our past experience executing the Communication &amp; Media Plan to make some changes for more effective results. Firstly, we will reassess our target audience and create a more detailed persona that takes into account the specific needs and interests of expats. With this new persona in mind, we will create new objectives that are more specific and measurable for the upcoming period. For example, we might aim to increase our follower count by a certain percentage within a set timeframe, or to increase the number of user-generated content submissions by a certain amount. We will also create a content calendar that is tailored to the interests and needs of our target audience, with a focus on interactive content that encourages engagement and conversation. In addition, we will increase our use of Reels and other video content, as we have found that this is an effective way to reach a wider audience. To track our progress and measure the success of our marketing efforts, we will continue to monitor our metrics and analyze the data to understand what is working and what can be improved upon. We will also consider running targeted ads on Instagram to reach a larger audience and drive more traffic to the Xpat website. Overall, by considering what we have learned from our past experience executing the Communication &amp; Media Plan for Xpat, we believe that we can create a more effective and engaging marketing strategy for the future.

            <li>A website designed for expats where they can create an account and where they fill in their interest, their hobbies, and a little story about themselves. 
<br>
We provide events where expats can sign up to and get to know each other during an activity. As a member you can see who has signed up and see their profiles with their information. In this way it makes it more personal.
<br>
Every event has one expact coordinater, this is a expat who coordinates that event and from who you can see the phone number and reach out to. In this way it is less scary to participate in a event.
<br>
To become a member you have to verifiy yourself. In this way we make sure that it is safe. The meeting points for the events are at public places so it is safer. Member can not see each other personal information unless a member choose to have that public.

				<br>
          <p>&nbsp;We made changes in our second lean canvas based upon the interviews we did. 
            By solution we made changes. First, we just had connecting expats through our website but during our interviews we found out that it isn’t enough. We came up with the ideas of creating events and the possibility to create an account. And that you can see how signup for the event. This is lowering the step of signing up to an event.
            Safety was also important; we took some steps in our making it as safe as possible. For example, you need to verify yourself first before you can make a account.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Our <strong>early adopters</strong> changed based on the fact that we found out that there is a possibility that your company pays for these kinds of products
&nbsp;</p>
					<br>
<h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;Assumption one:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Question:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>what is the maximum price they want to pay?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Answer: during our events we provides our expats with a few options regarding payment.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The first option was a subscription, where you pay monthly and have access to everything.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The second option was a subscription fee you pay one time.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The third option was the subscription fee of paying one time and paying service costs at every event you sign up for.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The fourth option was a subscription where you only subscribe to a specific category, for example sports. If you want to sign up for an event in another category you must pay more money.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;During the interviews we found out that most of our expats wanted to the third option. The one-time subscription fee and paying a service cost every time you go to a event. 
            The prices they wanted to pay were between 10 euro’s and 60 euro. To make the business a success for us we decide that the subscription fee is going to be 50 euro and the service cost 2.50 per event you sign up for.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Assumption two:&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>Question:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Are expats willing to make new contacts?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Answer: when we did our first interviews, we asked what the main problems for expats are.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The problem they mentioned where no reach of information of your new country, they couldn’t find everything they needed at one spot.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The second main problem was loneliness, they go to their work, they come home, and they repeat that every single day. But in the weekend, they were very lonely.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The last problem they mentioned was that it is almost impossible to make new contacts. This second and third problem are it easiest to combine for us and this is why we came up with our solution.
            During our last interviews we asked our expats if they will use our product, if they are willing to make new contact throughout our product. The answer was yes, every expats would use our product to gather new friends and do fun activities!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Explanation of every building block:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong>:
Throughout our interviews we found out that the biggest problem for expats it their loneliness, the no reach of information in their new country and that it is almost impossible to make new contacts while living abroad.
The existing alternatives are dating apps like tinder, but they have the romantic aspect, the expats don’t want that. The government provides information, but the expats still find it hard to gather all the information they need. And for making contact they can go to a bar, but it is hard to walk up to people.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Solution: </strong>With the information that we gathered by our interviews we found out that we needed to create a whole package solution for the problems of the expats. So, our product contains of multiple solutions in one. The expats can make an account on our website with their hobbies and interest etc. They can sign up for events to meet the other expats. Every event has a coordinator where the expats can see the phone number from and reach out to. And to become a member you need to verify yourself so that it is a safe as possible.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Unique value proposition</strong>:
            In our unique value proposition, we combine everything we stand for. The services explains our solution and what our final product is for this solution.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Unfair advantage</strong>:
            What other companies can’t copy from us are the typical Dutch events we organize. Because our organization is Dutch, we know the best options for connecting the expats.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Customer segments</strong>:
            Our target group is in the age range of 30-45 years old. This is because this is the age range of expats who come to the Netherlands and still want to make friends and do activities.
            Our early adopters are expats who are looking for the solution for a while, there is also an option that they get money from their company to participate in activities like this.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Key metrics</strong>:
            We gather information through our website where we can see important numbers. But also through our social network, Instagram. 
            All these numbers and information provide a clear overview for us as organization.&nbsp; </p>
          <p><strong>Channels</strong>:
            The online channels we use are only Instagram and the website.
            The offline channel we use is word-of-mouth.
            We use Instagram because this is the platform our target group uses. This can be used for our existing members but also for new potential members.
            The website is an information tool for potential new members, here they can see all the information they need to know about XPAT.
            Word-of-mouth is our marketing tool among expats.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Cost st</strong>ructure:
            Our fixed cost are salaries and taxes.
            Our variable cost are advertising cost on Instagram and the website hosting.
            The calculation shows how we make profit. The events we organize are our biggest income, for us it isn’t that much work, and we gain 2.50-euro service costs per event. This in combination with the salary we make a profit.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Revenue stream</strong>:
            Our revenue stream consists out of the fee of the subscriptions from members. 
            The service costs from signing up to an event.
            And the advertising fee from other companies advertising on our website. </p>

          <p><a href="https://www.connect-int.org">https://www.connect-int.org</a>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A company that is similar to our product with the same idea of connecting expats through events but their main goal in to inform while our goal is also the entertainment part. In our product we have the option to make an account and, in that way, also personally connect with expats while this company doesn’t have that.&nbsp;</p>
